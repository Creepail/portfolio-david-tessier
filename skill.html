                <p>My first year of study at IIM, has allowed me to learn some of the basic and a bit of the advanced technique used in creating a functionning website. I've learned trough my year of study and some personal projects the following programming language : Html, Css, PPH, Javascript and recently Scss. I am currently in the process of learning a brand new language that will allow me to add 3D animation and models to my website in the future : ThreeJS</p>
