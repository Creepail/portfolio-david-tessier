            <h2>Umbry quest</h2>
            <p>Umbry quest is a 2d platformer that i made in unity during my first year at IIM, in this game the player need to help umbry a mysterious creature made of shadow escape the ruin of a weird structure. While the gameplay was quite basic, i'm quite proud of Umbry Quest has my first real "game". Especially since all the sprite in the game we're made by me ! Trough this first experience in game making i've learned quite alot about unity, C# tools that will help me in the future make better games</p>
